Coursera Week 4 Data Preparation and Summarization Project

This project consists of downloading raw data gathered by researchers and cleaning and reorganizing it in a way that it can be used for analysis

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data Description of how the data was collected.

x_train.txt - Collected data used for machine learning traning purposes

x_test.txt - Collected data used to test the machine learning model developed with the training data

y_train.txt - training data regarding activity performed for each observation

y_test.txt - test data regarding activity performed for each observation

activity_labels.txt - descriptive names of activities performed by subjects

features.txt - names of each of the attributes of data collected

subject_train.txt - training data regrading subject number for each observation made

subject_test.txt - test data regrading subject number for each observation made



###Notes on the original (raw) data Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file General description of the file including:

Dimensions of the dataset
Summary of the data
Variables present in the dataset
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset) Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:

Class of the variable
Unique values/levels of the variable
Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels).
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1: If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

##Sources Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.

##Annex If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
